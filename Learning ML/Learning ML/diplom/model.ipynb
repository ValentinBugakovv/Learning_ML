На самом деле этот способ является предпочтительным для логистической регрессии, поскольку он позволит пропущенному значению не вносить никакого вклада в предсказание. Для деревьев часто лучшим вариантом оказывается замена пропуска на очень большое или очень маленькое значение — в этом случае при построении разбиения вершины можно будет отправить объекты с пропусками в отдельную ветвь дерева. Также есть и другие подходы — например, замена пропуска на среднее значение признака. Мы не требуем этого в задании, но при желании попробуйте разные подходы к обработке пропусков и сравните их между собой."
